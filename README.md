# MedModeling

As a team of aspiring engineers who have interests across that field that all converge around a central use of applying web development and data analytics to real-world problems, in this project, we want to create an easier tool for doctors and researchers to visualize quantified cardiac MRI data that is outputted from image analysis software that does not easily demonstrate gaps in data with wide time points.
